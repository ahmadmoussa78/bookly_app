## 🏗️ Architecture

The application follows the **MVVM (Model–View–ViewModel)** architecture:

- **Model**: API data and domain entities  
- **View**: Flutter UI components  
- **ViewModel**: Business logic and state management using Bloc and Cubit  

This approach ensures maintainability, testability, and scalability.

---

## 🧠 State Management

- **Bloc & Cubit**
- Cubit for simple state flows
- Bloc for complex logic
- Proper handling of loading, success, and error states

---

## 🌐 API Integration

- RESTful API consumption  
- API testing using **Postman**  
- Strongly typed Dart models  
- Centralized error and network handling
